    <h1>The City of Ramallah</h1>

    <p class="intro">
        Ramallah is one of the Palestinian regions known for traditional peasant embroidery, yet it is famous for its calm and elegant character compared to some other cities like Bethlehem or Hebron, whose embroidery is dominated by dense decorations and multiple colors.
