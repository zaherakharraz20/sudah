  <h1 class="page-title">Palestinian Embroidery: A Living Memory</h1>
   <p>
    Palestinian embroidery is recognized as one of the most prominent elements of Palestine's intangible cultural heritage, serving as a visual form of expression that documents the history of Palestinian society and its connection to place. Its patterns and colors carry symbolic meanings that reflect the identities of Palestinian cities and villages, while the diversity of its regional styles demonstrates the deep-rooted cultural and civilizational richness of the Palestinian people across generations.
  </p>
  <p>
    For decades, Palestinian embroidery has been subjected to systematic attempts of erasure and distortion by the occupation, including the appropriation of traditional designs and their attribution to other cultures, as well as the restriction of Palestinian cultural symbols in public spaces. Despite these practices, Palestinian embroidery has continued to function as a form of cultural resilience, maintaining its presence in everyday life and social occasions, and being transmitted across generations as a symbol of national identity and belonging.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the contemporary context, Palestinian embroidery is regarded as a fundamental component of national heritage that requires protection and documentation, not only for its aesthetic value but also for its crucial role in safeguarding Palestinian cultural identity and resisting cultural erasure. This art form stands as a living testament to the continuity of Palestinian historical memory and its ability to endure in the face of ongoing challenges
